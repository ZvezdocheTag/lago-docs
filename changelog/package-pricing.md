# Use a Package pricing to charge usage

It's now possible to apply a Package pricing model to a charge.
To do so, go to one of your [Plans](../docs/guide/plans/charges#the-package-charge-model), import a new charge and select the **Package pricing** model.

Ths pricing model is very useful if you want to apply a price to a range of units. The price will be applied to the whole range, regardless the number of units consumed.
