# Invoice monthly charges for a plan paid yearly
Before the release of this feature, usaged-based features (charges) were following the plan period. If the plan period was invoiced yearly, the charges were invoiced yearly.

It's now possible to **invoice billable metrics on a montly basis** for a plan billed yearly. The base amount of the plan will be invoice yearly (in-arrears or in-advance), but your usage based features will be invoiced on a monthly basis.

**To do so:**
1. Access a **Plan**;
2. Define a plan **yearly**;
3. Price **additional charges** from your billable metrics; and
4. Turn `on` the toggle for **applying charges monthly**.

By switching on, **all the charges** will be invoiced monthly even if the plan is yearly.
