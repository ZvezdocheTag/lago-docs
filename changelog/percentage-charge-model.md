# Percentage charge model
Inside the **Plans**, by creating a charge, you can now select the **percentage charge model**.

This feature is pretty useful for industries willing to take a `% + fixed fee` out of a usage-based features (for banking or charity industry, for instance). These fees are applied on the *units to be charged* (e.g. the aggregation result of your billable metric).

The fixed charge can either be applied per **each single unit** or for **all units**.
