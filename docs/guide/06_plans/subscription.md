# Subscriptions
By creating a subscription, you **assign a Plan to a Customer**. Subscriptions can be added when creating a customer or added seperately later on.

This customer is now invoiced based on the fixed recurring charges and the usage-based charges belonging to this Plan.

## Billing cycles of subscription
In order to make billing cycles easy, Lago automatically aligns the subscriptions with the calendar. 

For instance, if your customer is assigned to a subscription on March 15:
- The first invoice is received for the billing period of March 15 - March 31
- The next invoice is created for the billing period of April 1 - April 30
- The following one is created for the billing period of May 1 - May 31 ... and so on.
