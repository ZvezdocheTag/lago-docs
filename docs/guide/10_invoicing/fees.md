# Fees
If a charge is related to how much you price the usage of a billable metric, a fee is when this charge is invoiced and ready to be paid.

As Lago is usage-based and related to consumption, each billable metric that has been consumed by your customers will appear as a fee item in your invoices.

## Types of fees
You can have 2 types of fees:
- **`subscription` fees:** link to the base amount of the plan.
- **`charge` fees:** link to the billable metrics used for usage-based billing.

**Also, all fees hold:**
- The price in `amount_cents`
- The `amount_currency`
- The `vat_amount_cents`
- The `vat_amount_currency`

## Fee structure
The fee object is embedded in the invoice object triggered when a billing period has been completed.
