# Integration Testing
This step-by-step integration guide will help you get started with Lago.

## Foreword
At the moment, each Lago account is associated with a unique environment. It is not currently possible to have your test environment and production environment in the same account.

However, we can suggest different workarounds:
1. **Create two accounts** to get access to two environments, one that could be called "Company Staging" and another one that could be called "Company Production"; or

2. **Leverage our two hosting solutions** to use Lago Cloud as a test environment and Lago Open Source as a production environment (or vice versa).

Please note that the above workarounds will require you to replicate the same setup in both environments.

:::info
In the future, you will be able to get access to a test environment and a production environment with the same Lago account.
